              During my internship at Iver, I had the chance to collaborate with
              three fellow students on our bachelorâ€™s thesis project. We
              embraced Scrum as our agile methodology, which helped us stay
              organized and iterate quickly. For the backend, we utilized Java
              with Spring Boot, while our frontend was built using Vue.js. We
              also got to work with real customer data from Azure, extracting
              the information and storing it in a custom Cosmos DB on Azure.
              From there, we developed a Vue.js interface that allowed users to
              interactively sort, search, and retrieve specific data, making the
              entire experience both educational and highly engaging.

              Most of my coursework centered around creating backends in Java,
              which has made me highly comfortable and confident in Java-based
              development. On the frontend, I've worked with React, Next.js, and
              Vue.js, giving me a versatile skill set for building complete web
              applications. Additionally, I've gained experience in C# (with
              .NET Framework), Python, and Arduino, and I tend to pick up new
              languages and frameworks rapidly.

              The page you're viewing right now is a purely web-based
              application built with a Next.js frontend, TypeScript, and
              Material-UI. I developed this site as a hobby project while
              exploring new employment opportunities, and as a way to keep my
              frontend skills fresh. It's been an enjoyable process, and I hope
              reading through it has been equally insightful for you.
